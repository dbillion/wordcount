Title: "The Great Cauliflower Caper"

Granny Mabel’s grocery list said “one cauliflower,” but the universe had other plans. Armed with a reusable tote bag and a pep talk (“You’re a functional adult!”), I marched into the bustling farmers’ market, immediately tripping over a terrier wearing a tiny sombrero. The dog side-eyed me like I’d ruined his TikTok shoot.

At the vegetable stall, I reached for a pristine cauliflower. “THAT’S A ROMANESCO!” barked the vendor, a man with a handlebar mustache and the energy of a Shakespearean actor. “It’s fractal! Philosophical!” I apologized, but he’d already launched into a monologue about Pythagorean vegetable cults. I backed away slowly, colliding with a pyramid of artisanal pumpkins. They rolled into the street, causing a traffic jam of angry scooters and a mime who actually screamed.

Aunt Gertrude’s parrot, Kevin (who I’d “borrowed” for “emotional support”), chose that moment to escape his cage and dive-bomb the honey stall. He emerged sticky and vengeful, squawking, “YOLO!” while pelting figs at the cheese merchant.

By noon, I’d been banned from three stalls, adopted a stray goat (long story), and lost a shoe to a suspiciously sentient puddle. The cauliflower? Forgotten. But I did leave with:

A jar of “moon-charged” pickles

The goat (now named Steve)

A lifetime supply of regret

Granny called later: “Did you get lost in the Andes?!” I handed Steve the phone. He ate it.

Moral of the story: Always send a text. “Cauliflower = chaos. Bringing home goat. Pray for us.” 🌱🐐💥
